üß† Homework 1 ‚Äî Ansible Automation Project
üìò Objective

Set up an Ansible Controller on Ubuntu and connect it to four client nodes (2 Amazon Linux 2023 and 2 Ubuntu).
Then, write a playbook with three plays to automate Apache installation, Git setup, and display a custom debug message across all clients.

üñ•Ô∏è Project Overview
üß© Tasks

Setup:

Launch one Ubuntu EC2 instance as the Ansible Controller.

Launch four client EC2 instances (2 Ubuntu + 2 Amazon Linux 2023).

Configure SSH key-based authentication between the controller and all clients.

Verify connections using the ping module.

Playbook Requirements:

PLAY 1: Deploy Apache Webserver on Ubuntu clients with a custom web page message.

PLAY 2: Install Git on all Ubuntu clients.

PLAY 3: Use the DEBUG module to display your name on all hosts using a variable.

Submission:

Push your playbook file to GitHub.

Include screenshots showing successful execution and results.

Export your output as a PDF file for submission.

## Install Ansible on Controller

- Configure the PPA on your system and install Ansible:

```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install software-properties-common
$ sudo add-apt-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
$ sudo apt install ansible
```

## Generate SSH Key Pair on Controller
```bash
-ssh-keygen -t rsa
```
-Press Enter for all prompts.

- share the public key with the cleints by pasting it into authorised key file on each cleint and test the connectivity from the controller.

## üìò Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrated the setup and automation capabilities of **Ansible** across multiple Linux environments.

Starting from launching an **Ubuntu Controller** and four clients (**2√ó Ubuntu**, **2√ó Amazon Linux 2023**), SSH keys were used for secure connectivity, and the setup was verified using the **ping ad-hoc module**.

The three-play Ansible playbook achieved the following:
1. Deployed **Apache Webserver** on Ubuntu clients with a custom welcome message.
2. Installed **Git** on Ubuntu clients.
3. Used the **Debug** module to display the user‚Äôs name across **all managed hosts**.

Through this exercise, we demonstrated how Ansible simplifies configuration management, package installation, and remote task execution with just a few lines of YAML ‚Äî proving its efficiency for both small and large-scale automation.
